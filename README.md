A list of basic C codes as an attempt to help those who are new to coding. These were my first codes at the University and I hope they're useful.
I'll try to leave this readme document always up to date as if it were a Coding Diary!! :)

Today (2019.07.06) I'm learning how to use git commands on my own and I love it!
